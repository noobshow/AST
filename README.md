#AST
An abstract syntax tree application

##Goals
The goal of the library is to be able to compile an abstract syntax tree to C.

This would make the creation of a compile-to-C language quite a bit easier, as the output can be a much simpler data structure rather than having to manipulate strings.

##Progress

- [x] Represent unary and binary operators

- [x] Respect precedence set by the tree

- [x] Represent function calls

- [x] Represent casts

- [ ] Represent assignments

- [ ] Represent basic conditionals (if, while, do/while)

- [ ] Represent blocks

- [ ] Represent for loops

- [ ] Represent functions

- [ ] Represent type declarations

- [ ] Symbol table and analysis

- [ ] Output LISP-like representation

- [ ] Output C code

- [ ] Optimization of the code

- [ ] Syntax and semantics checking while in the tree form
